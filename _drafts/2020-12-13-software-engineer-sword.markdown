I'd like to start this post of with a quote...

Where did this quote come from?

Right here in this post. And years from now when this a super common expression you can proudly say that you saw it here at its original source. As for the pronouns I only used male pronouns for aesthetic purposed but it really applies to any gender. Although Samurai is a masculine term, in ancient Japan there was a female equivalent called "Onna-Bugeisha" who received the same martial arts training and fought alongside their male counterparts.

In many ways the Samurai sword is exactly like the code editor. Both are tools used to accomplish the task at hand.

Choosing a code editor is almost a religious decision for a software engineer. Some would say it's the single most important tool for software development. Without it, we'd have to write code on TextEdit or a bare bones text editor without syntax highlighting, file exploration, or automatic refactoring tools.

While most of my career has been on JetBrains' InteliJ, I have made the switch over to Microsoft's VSCode as part of my current job. Although it was sad to abandaon InteliJ, I was eager to explore what all the buzz was about with VSCode. Also as an engineer, I believe it's important to try new things and see what things work best.

Overall I've been happy with VSCode. I would say there is some gray area about which is better and no obvious winner, but I would say VSCode has an edge over InteliJ for front end development. Here's why...
